## 🎯 Core Features

### 💻 Front-End
- **Dynamic Routing**: 
  - Built with Next.js, using its App Router to handle dynamic pages like member profiles, event details, and announcements.
  - Example: A URL like `/members/john-doe` dynamically generates content from Firestore for "John Doe."  

- **Framer Motion Animations**:
  - Smooth page transitions and micro-interactions enhance the user experience.
  - Example: Cards fade in while scrolling, buttons subtly animate on hover.

- **Mobile-First Design**:
  - Every page adapts seamlessly to devices of all sizes, ensuring an optimal experience for all users.
  - Tailwind CSS’s utility classes streamline the responsive layout process.

---

### 🔗 Back-End
- **Firebase Firestore Integration**:  
  - Dynamic data retrieval for events, board members, and announcements.  
  - Real-time updates for seamless content management.  

- **Firebase Storage**:  
  - Secure storage for images and media assets.  
  - Example: Uploading board member profile photos directly through the admin panel and dynamically displaying them.

- **Scalable Architecture**:
  - Firestore’s NoSQL structure allows for easy expansion as more data is added, ensuring the project remains future-proof.

---

### 🛡️ Admin Panel
The admin panel is an essential part of the project, designed for efficient content management. It allows administrators to:
1. **Add, Edit, or Remove Board Members**:  
   - Includes fields for name, position, profile image, and bio.  
   - Real-time Firestore updates ensure instant changes.

2. **Manage Events**:  
   - Add upcoming events with details like date, description, and images.  
   - Dynamically rendered for users without page reloads.

3. **Future-Ready Enhancements** (In Progress):  
   - Role-based access control for secure multi-user management.  
   - Integration of analytics to track user engagement.
